    <p><strong>WHAT IS A RESEARCH STUDY?</strong></p>
    
    <p>A research study is when scientists try to answer a question about something that we don&rsquo;t know enough about.  Participating may not help you or others.  People volunteer to be in a research study.  The decision about whether or not to take part is totally up to you. You can also agree to take part now and later change your mind. Whatever you decide is okay.  It will not affect your ability to get medical care at Research University.  <br /><br />
